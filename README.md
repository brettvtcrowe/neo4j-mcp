# Neo4j MCP

Official repository for the Neo4j MCP.

## Status

This project is currently under active development and is not ready for production use.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Neo4j database instance (4.0 or later recommended)
- **APOC plugin installed** - This is required for optimal schema introspection. You can easily install APOC through Neo4j Desktop by going to your database â†’ Plugins â†’ APOC â†’ Install.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neo4j/mcp.git
cd mcp
```

### 2. Set up Go Environment

Ensure your Go environment is properly configured:

```bash
# Check Go installation
go version
```

Set up GOPATH and GOBIN (if not already configured in your favorite shell file, such as: .bashrc,.zshrc)

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
```

### 3. Install the Neo4j MCP Server

```bash
go install -C cmd/neo4j-mcp
```

This will install the `neo4j-mcp` binary to your `$GOBIN` directory.

### 4. Configure VSCode MCP

Create or update your VSCode MCP configuration file (`mcp.json`), as documented here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "neo4j": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "neo4j-mcp", // Use full path to binary or ensure neo4j-mcp is in PATH
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "password",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Notes:**

- Adjust the environment variables according to your Neo4j instance configuration
- For Neo4j Desktop: typically uses `bolt://localhost:7687` with your custom password
- For Neo4j Aura: use the connection URI provided in your Aura console
- Ensure the `neo4j-mcp` binary path is correct or the command is in your system PATH

After configuration, restart VSCode to load the MCP server. You can verify the connection by checking the MCP status in VSCode.

Open the VSCode chat in agentic mode and ask about your configured Neo4j database.

## MCP Usage

The Neo4j MCP server provides two main tools for interacting with your Neo4j database through Model Context Protocol:

### Available Tools

#### 1. `get-schema`

Retrieves comprehensive schema information from your Neo4j database, including:

- Node labels
- Relationship types
- Property keys and their data types
- Indexes and constraints

This tool is read-only and idempotent, making it safe to call repeatedly.

**Example usage:**

```
Get the database schema
```

#### 2. `run-cypher`

Executes Cypher queries against your Neo4j database. This tool supports:

- Read and write operations
- Parameterized queries for security
- Complex graph traversals and analytics

**Important:** This tool can perform destructive operations, so use with caution in production environments.

**Example usage:**

```
Find all Person nodes and their relationships
```

```
Create a new node with label User and name property "John"
```

```
Match all nodes connected to a specific node within 3 hops
```

### Integration with AI Assistants

Once configured, you can interact with your Neo4j database using natural language through supported AI assistants:

- **Schema Exploration**: "What's the structure of my database?" or "Show me all node types"
- **Data Querying**: "Find all users who purchased products in the last month"
- **Graph Analysis**: "Show me the shortest path between two specific nodes"
- **Data Modification**: "Create a new customer node with email and name"

The MCP server automatically translates your natural language requests into appropriate Cypher queries and executes them against your database.

### Security Considerations

- The `run-cypher` tool can execute any Cypher query, including destructive operations
- Ensure your Neo4j user has appropriate permissions for your use case
- Consider using a read-only user for exploration and analysis tasks
- Always validate results before applying changes in production environments

## Logging

This project follows the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) recommendation that all log output should be written to **stderr** to keep **stdout** clean for protocol communication.

We achieve this by using Go's standard `log` package, which writes to stderr by default. This ensures:

- **MCP Compliance**: stdout remains clean for JSON-RPC protocol messages
- **Proper Stream Separation**: Application logs go to stderr, protocol messages to stdout
